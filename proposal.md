## Overview
We are interested in developing one game and one simulation for our final project for CSIS 225.


## Space Invaders Game
For our game, we plan to implement a version of Space Invaders.  In this game, the player operates a laser cannon by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliens.  

This project will cover many of the requirements of the project: it will use Java Swing components and Java graphics with event-handlers for use of the keyboard (to control the cannon that fires at the aliens).  There are also several objects we will need to create to make the game work that will require a class hierarchy.

## Catan Simulation
For the simulation, we plan to simulate the game Settlers of Catan.  The players in the game represent settlers establishing colonies on the island of Catan. Players build settlements, cities, and roads to connect them as they settle the island. The game board, which represents the island, is composed of hexagonal tiles (hexes) of different land types, which are laid out randomly at the beginning of each game. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore).  On each player's turn, two six-sided dice are rolled to determine which hexes produce resources. 

The goal of the game is to reach ten victory points. Players score one point for each settlement they own and two for each city. Catan will use Java Swing components and Java graphics with event-handlers for buttons and placing pieces on the map. We will need to keep track of each player's resources, points, settlements, cities and roads.  To run the game smoothly we will also need a class hierarchy to code this game.
